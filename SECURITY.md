# Security Policy

## Overview

PC_Workman is system monitoring software that requires administrative privileges to access hardware sensors and control fan speeds. This level of access demands rigorous security practices.
This document outlines the security measures implemented in PC_Workman, how to report vulnerabilities, and what users can do to verify the safety of releases.

---

## Security Measures (Active Since v1.6.3)

Starting with v1.6.3 (January 2026), PC_Workman implemented professional-grade security practices:

### Always-On GitHub Security

- **Advanced CodeQL** - Automated code scanning for vulnerabilities on every commit
- **Private Vulnerability Reporting** - Secure channel for security researchers to report issues
- **Security Advisories** - Public disclosure when issues are found and fixed
- **Dependabot Alerts** - Automatic notification of vulnerable dependencies

### Release Security (Every Major Update)

- **Sigstore Digital Signatures** - Cryptographic proof that releases are authentic
- **VirusTotal Scanning** - Every .exe tested against 70+ antivirus engines before release
- **Documented Testing** - Version numbers, dates, and results publicly recorded
- **Reproducible Builds** - Source code tagged and archived for each release

### Sigstore Certificate

**Status:** Active  
**Available Since:** January 20, 2026  
**Valid For:** 90 days  
**Renewal:** Automatic with each stable release

Every PC_Workman release is signed with Sigstore. Verify the signature:

```bash
sigstore verify github \
  PC_Workman_HCK_<version>.exe \
  --bundle sigstore.bundle
```

If signature verification fails, do not run the executable. Report the issue immediately.

### VirusTotal Scanning

**Status:** Active  
**Started:** v1.6.3  
**Frequency:** Every new .exe release  
**Current Status:** 0/70 clean  
**Last Scanned:** v1.6.4 (January 24, 2026)

Before publishing any executable, it is uploaded to VirusTotal and verified against 70+ antivirus engines. Users can verify this independently at [virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com).

### OpenSSF Best Practices Badge

**Status:** In Progress (25% complete)  
**Target:** 100% compliance by v2.0

PC_Workman is working toward full compliance with [OpenSSF Best Practices](https://bestpractices.coreinfrastructure.org/) criteria:

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Download from Official Sources Only

**Official Distribution Channels:**
- GitHub Releases: [github.com/HuckleR2003/PC_Workman_HCK/releases](https://github.com/HuckleR2003/PC_Workman_HCK/releases)
- Project Website: [huckler2003.github.io/PC_Workman_HCK](https://huckler2003.github.io/PC_Workman_HCK)
- Sourceforge: [https://sourceforge.net/projects/pc-workman-hck/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pc-workman-hck/)

**Unofficial sources are not endorsed and may distribute modified or malicious versions:**
- Third-party download sites
- File sharing platforms
- Mirror sites
- Torrent networks

Executables received via email, Discord, or other messaging platforms should be considered untrusted.

### Verify Digital Signatures

After download, verify the Sigstore signature before execution:

```bash
# Install sigstore CLI if not present
pip install sigstore

# Verify signature
sigstore verify github PC_Workman_HCK_<version>.exe --bundle sigstore.bundle
```

Expected output: `Signature verified successfully`

If verification fails, delete the file immediately and report the issue.

### Scan with VirusTotal

Independent verification is recommended:

1. Visit [virustotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com)
2. Upload the downloaded .exe file
3. Review scan results

**Expected result:** 0/70+ detections

Any detections should be reported immediately. False positives are possible but rare.

### Verify File Hashes

Release notes include SHA256 hashes. Verify file integrity:

**Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
Get-FileHash PC_Workman_HCK_<version>.exe -Algorithm SHA256
```

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
sha256sum PC_Workman_HCK_<version>.exe
```

Compare output with published hash in release notes.

### Review Source Code

PC_Workman is open source. Users can audit the code before use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/HuckleR2003/PC_Workman_HCK.git
cd PC_Workman_HCK
git checkout tags/v<version>
```

All releases are tagged and archived. Source code is available for inspection.
