## Overview

PC_Workman is a real-time system monitor built over 800 hours on hardware that peaked at 94°C during development. It answers the question most monitoring tools ignore: not just WHAT is happening, but WHY.

![PC_Workman Demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fd2e9ed3-7b61-4c21-91df-7b41d66495fb)

**Core features:**
- Real-time CPU, GPU, RAM, and network monitoring
- Process intelligence (identifies what's consuming resources)
- AI-powered diagnostics via hck_GPT integration
- Historical trend analysis with time-travel capability
- Gaming analytics with bottleneck detection

**What makes it different:**

Traditional monitors show "CPU: 87%" and stop there. PC_Workman shows CPU at 87%, tells you which process caused it, when it started, and what the historical pattern looks like. Click any point in history to see what was running at that exact moment.

Features nobody else has: voltage spike detection with anomaly correlation, local pattern learning (no cloud), 7-day recurring habit detection.

Built for understanding system behavior, not just watching numbers change.

## Architecture

PC_Workman uses a modular, threaded architecture optimized for low resource usage:

```
PC_Workman/
├── core/              # Background-threaded system monitoring
├── hck_gpt/           # Local AI insights engine (no external API)
├── hck_stats_engine/  # SQLite pipeline: minute/hourly/daily/monthly aggregation
├── ui/
│   ├── windows/       # Main window modes (expanded, minimal)
│   ├── components/    # Reusable widgets (charts, LED bars, tooltips)
│   └── pages/         # Full-page views (monitoring, fan control)
├── data/
│   ├── logs/          # CSV logs (raw, hourly, daily, weekly, monthly)
│   ├── cache/         # Runtime cache & process patterns
│   └── hck_stats.db   # SQLite long-term storage (WAL mode)
└── tests/             # Unit tests
```

**Design principles:**
- Dynamic component registry with auto-registration
- Background thread isolation (GUI never blocks on system calls)
- WAL mode SQLite for concurrent read/write
- Graceful degradation (SQLite failure falls back to CSV)
- Widget reuse pattern (eliminates destroy/recreate overhead)

## What's New [1.6.8] - 2026-02-17 - CURRENT

### hck_GPT Intelligence System
- Local insights engine: habit tracking, anomaly awareness, personalized teasers
- "Today Report" button with detailed session analysis
- Today Report includes: session/lifetime uptime, CPU/GPU/RAM chart, top processes, alert status
- 7-day recurring pattern detection with context-aware messages
- New commands: `stats`, `alerts`, `insights`, `teaser` (Polish and English)
- Smooth gradient banner with auto-greeting and periodic insight ticker

### HCK Stats Engine v2 (SQLite Long-Term Storage)

**Data Pipeline:**
- SQLite-based aggregation: minute → hourly → daily → weekly → monthly
- Process tracking: per-hour and per-day CPU/RAM breakdown per process
- WAL mode for concurrent UI reads and scheduler writes
- Automatic pruning: 7 days of minute data, 90 days of hourly, forever for daily+
- Graceful degradation: SQLite failure falls back to CSV logging
- New modules: `db_manager`, `aggregator`, `process_aggregator`, `query_api`, `events`

**In-memory accumulator pattern:**
```python
{(hour_ts, process_name): {cpu_sum, cpu_max, ram_sum, count, active_secs}}
```
- `accumulate_second()`: lightweight dict updates every second
- `flush_hourly_processes()`: batch write at hour boundary
- `aggregate_daily_processes()`: daily rollup from hourly stats

**Stability guarantees:**
- Every operation wrapped in try/except (never crashes scheduler)
- Write-only on scheduler thread, read-only on UI thread (separate connections)
- Atomic transactions (crash mid-aggregation triggers rollback)
- No new dependencies (sqlite3 is Python stdlib)

### MONITORING & ALERTS - Time-Travel Statistics Center
- Temperature area chart with 1D/3D/1W/1M scale selection
- Spike detection (mean + 1.5×std) with yellow glow highlighting
- Hover tooltips with CPU/RAM/GPU values at each time point
- Voltage/Load multi-line chart with anomaly detection
- Stats panels: Today AVG, Lifetime AVG, Max Safe, Current, Spikes count
- AI learning status badges per metric
- Events log from SQLite database

### Overlay CPU/RAM/GPU
- Redefined as always-on-top Toplevel window (runs outside main program, on desktop)
- Auto-launches on startup via `root.after(1500, ...)`
- Draggable, frameless, hidden from taskbar (`-toolwindow` flag)

### My PC Improvements
- Hey-USER table replaced with cropped ProInfoTable (MOTHERBOARD + CPU sections only)
- Quick action buttons now navigate to actual pages (Stats & Alerts → Monitoring, etc.)
- Stability Tests page with real diagnostics (file integrity, engine status, log analysis)

### Sidebar Navigation Stability
- Dashboard-only updates: `_update_hardware_cards` and `_update_top5_processes` guarded by `current_view == "dashboard"`
- `winfo_exists()` guards on all widget update methods
- Fixed routing IDs for new subitems (temperature, voltage, alerts)

### Performance Optimization

**Threading model:**
- Background-threaded `psutil.process_iter()` - GUI thread never blocks on system calls
- `read_snapshot()` provides non-blocking, instant GUI updates from cached data

**Update cadence:**
- Main loop: 300ms → 1000ms (70% reduction in overhead)
- Hardware cards: 2s intervals
- System tray: 3s intervals
- Widget reuse pattern for TOP 5 processes (no destroy/recreate cycle)

**Graphics optimization:**
- Navigation button gradients drawn once (removed per-pixel `<Configure>` redraw)
- Realtime chart: reusable canvas rectangles with 2s interval
- Chart rendering refactored from pixel-by-pixel PhotoImage (70k iterations/frame) to canvas.coords() updates

**Telemetry sanitization:**
- Strict filtering excludes system noise (Idle, Interrupts, Memory Compression)
- 100% CPU cap per process prevents overflow anomalies
- `_is_system_noise()` filter prevents false "heavy app" alerts

### Dashboard Chart
- All time filters working: LIVE, 1H, 4H, 1D, 1W, 1M
- Pulls real data from `hck_stats_engine` SQLite (minute/hourly/daily tables)
- Auto-refresh for historical data every 30s
- Standardized default filter to LIVE mode

### Stats Engine Fixes
- Lifetime uptime persists across sessions (shutdown flush + multi-table query)
- Multi-tier fallback system: merges daily, hourly, minute stats without overlap
- System idle process filtered at source (eliminates "1012% CPU" display bugs)

### Codebase Cleanup
- Removed unused modules: `utils/`, `settings/`, `expandable_list.py`, dead animation code
- Removed in-app mini-monitor overlay (kept external desktop overlay)
- Integrated temperature data pipeline: scheduler → aggregator → SQLite
- Purged obsolete fan dashboard versions (ai, pro, ultra)
- Consolidated to single `fan_dashboard.py` (3 files deleted, ~100KB saved)
- Removed all `__pycache__` and `.pyc` files from repository
- Fixed broken imports after cleanup

## What's New [1.6.3] - 2026-01-12
