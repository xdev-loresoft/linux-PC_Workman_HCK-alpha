## Overview
PC_Workman is a desktop system monitoring application built entirely in Python (Tkinter). It combines real-time hardware diagnostics, a local AI insights engine, long-term SQLite statistics, and optimization tools — all in a single-window dark-theme interface inspired by MSI Afterburner, HWiNFO, and Apple's design language.

**What makes it different from Task Manager or HWMonitor:**
- **Explains the "why"** — not just "CPU: 87%", but *which process* is responsible and whether it's a recurring pattern
- **Long-term memory** — SQLite pipeline stores minute/hourly/daily/monthly stats across sessions; your lifetime PC usage is always available
- **Local AI insights** — `hck_GPT` InsightsEngine detects habits, anomalies, gaming sessions, and generates personalized teasers — no external API, no cloud, fully offline
- **Time-travel diagnostics** — click any historical point in the Monitoring & Alerts center to see what was running at that moment
- **One-click optimization** — Turbo Boost toggle, services wizard, startup cleanup, telemetry disable — all with rollback safety
-

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Main Dashboard — Real-Time Command Center

The primary view. Everything at a glance, zero clicks to understand your PC's state.

**Layout** (1160×575px, sidebar + 3-column content):

| Left Column | Center | Right Column |
|---|---|---|
| TOP 5 User Processes | Realtime Chart (CPU/RAM/GPU) | TOP 5 System Processes |
| AI Info Panel | Live Metrics + Time Filters | |
| | Turbo Boost + Optimization Tools | |

**Session Average Bars** — three horizontal bars (CPU blue `#3b82f6`, GPU green `#10b981`, RAM amber `#fbbf24`) showing running averages since app launch. Calculated from up to 1000 samples with per-tick updates.

**Hardware Cards** — three ultra-compact cards (CPU, RAM, GPU) each showing:
- Real hardware model name (via WMIC/psutil, cached)
- Mini sparkline chart (22px tall, dark `#0f1117` background)
- Temperature bar (4px, heat-colored) with live reading
- Health status indicator ("Wszystko OK" / "Wymagana inspekcja")
- Load classification (Idle / Standard / Heavy / Critical)

**Realtime Chart** — canvas-based bar chart with 100-sample rolling buffer:
- Three overlaid series: CPU (dark blue `#1e3a8a`), RAM (amber `#fbbf24`), GPU (green `#10b981`)
- **6 time filters**: LIVE (rolling buffer), 1H, 4H (query `minute_stats`), 1D (`hourly_stats`), 1W, 1M (`daily_stats`)
- Data pulled directly from `hck_stats_engine` SQLite database
- Reusable canvas rectangle pool — items created once, only `canvas.coords()` updated per tick
- Auto-refresh every ~30s on historical modes

**TOP 5 Process Panels** — widget-reuse pattern (no destroy/recreate):
- Each row: process name (14 chars), CPU bar (blue, 30px), RAM bar (amber, 30px), percentage labels
- Gradient row backgrounds (`#1c1f26` → `#24272e`)
- User processes (left) vs System processes (right), updated every 3s
- System idle/noise processes filtered at source

**Turbo Boost Card** — one-click performance toggle:
- Status: ON (green glow `#6ee7b7`) / OFF (red glow `#fca5a5`) with animated color cycling
- "Configure" button opens Optimization overlay, "Launch/Stop" toggles boost
- Blue gradient header (`#3b82f6`) with glowing effect (500ms cycle)

**Optimization Tools Card** — green gradient (`#10b981`):
- Active tools counter (0/16) with animated green glow
- Links to full optimization page

**AI Info Panel** (bottom-left, 50px height):
- Purple accent (`#a78bfa`), Consolas 8pt, dark background `#0a0e27`
- Typing animation: 70ms/char type, 6s hold, 30ms/3-char delete, 1.5s pause
- 4 rotating messages about PC Workman
- Blinking cursor (600ms toggle)

**Performance**: Main loop at 1s cadence, hardware cards every 2s, tray every 3s, process lists every 3s. All `psutil.process_iter()` calls run on a background daemon thread — GUI thread only reads cached snapshots.

---

### 2. My PC — Hardware & Health

A tabbed diagnostic center with 5 planned sections (Central fully implemented, others Coming Soon). Left sidebar with quick action buttons, right panel with scrollable hardware tables.

**Quick Action Buttons** (6 buttons, canvas-rendered gradients with hover brightness):

| Button | Color | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Health Report | Blue `#3b82f6` | Opens detailed component history |
| Cleanup | Red `#ef4444` | Opens optimization services wizard |
| Stats & Alerts | Yellow-gold gradient | Opens Monitoring & Alerts center |
| Optimization & Services | Dark yellow → red gradient | Opens optimization dashboard |
| First Setup & Drivers | Red → purple gradient | Driver updates + useless services off |
| Stability Tests | Green `#10b981` | Internal diagnostics (file integrity, engine status, logs) |

Each button has an info tooltip (hover "i" icon) with 2-line description.

**Hardware Info Panel** (right side, 408px wide, scrollable):

**Hey-USER Header** — shows computer hostname from `socket.gethostname()`, header image or blue fallback bar.

**MOTHERBOARD Section** (trapezoid header with icon):
- Model name badge (retrieved via WMIC, first 15 chars)
- **Voltage Table**: +12V, +5V, +3.3V, DDR4 — each with Current/Min/Max columns
- **Temperature Table**: CPU Core, CPU Socket, SYS — Current/Min/Max
- **Disk Space Strip**: up to 4 partitions, color-coded (green <75%, yellow 75-90%, red >90%)
- **Body Fans Strip**: CPU and chassis fan RPM readings

**CPU Section** (trapezoid header with icon):
- Model badge (via `platform.processor()` or WMIC, 25 chars)
- **Voltage Table**: IA Offset, GT Offset, LLC/Ring, Sys Agent, V/O Max
- **Temperature Table**: Package, Core Max, per-core readings (up to 6 cores, live from `psutil`)
- **Power Table**: Package power, IA Cores power
- **Clocks Table**: Per-core current/min/max MHz from `psutil.cpu_freq(percpu=True)`

**Table Design** — mini data tables with:
- Yellow title bar (`#fbbf24`) with green "OK" badge
- Black column headers (CURRENT / MIN / MAX)
- Dark rows (`#0f1117`) with white values on black backgrounds
- 5-6pt fonts for maximum information density

**Full Hardware Table Popup** — "Show Full Table" opens a 500×600 Toplevel with the complete ProInfoTable component (all MOTHERBOARD + CPU + GPU sections).

---

### 3. Fan Dashboard — Interactive Cooling Control

MSI Afterburner-inspired fan curve editor with a dark navy theme (`#0a0e27`) and red/purple accents.

**Profile System** — 5 trapezoidal profile buttons across the top:
- **Default** / **Silent** / **AI** (adaptive) / **P1** / **P2** (user-saved)
- Active: red gradient fill (`#8b0000` → `#ef4444`), white text
- Inactive: dark gray (`#1a1d24`), gray text
- Profiles saved as JSON to `data/profiles/`

**Fan Status Cards** (2×2 grid) — each card shows:
- Fan name (CPU FAN, GPU FAN, FAN 1, FAN 2)
- Connection status (green "Connected" / gray "Not available")
- Device model (e.g., "i5-13600K", "RTX 4070", "Noctua")
- **Circular RPM indicator**: red arc (`#ef4444`) showing speed percentage, RPM value centered

**Interactive Fan Curve Graph** (550×150 canvas, centerpiece):
- **Grid**: dashed lines at 0/25/50/75/100% (speed) × 0/20/40/60/80/100°C (temperature)
- **Purple gradient fill**: layered semi-transparent purple under the curve
- **Curve line**: purple `#a855f7`, 3px width, connecting 6 draggable control points
- **Control points**: white circles with purple outer glow — **drag to reshape the curve in real-time**
- **Axis labels**: Y = fan speed %, X = temperature °C
- **Live reading**: top-right corner shows current temp → speed mapping (e.g., "100°C → 90%")

Default curve: (0°C, 25%) → (20°C, 30%) → (40°C, 40%) → (60°C, 55%) → (80°C, 75%) → (100°C, 90%)

**Horizontal Sliders** — two modern sliders:
- Dark track (`#374151`) with red progress fill (`#ef4444`)
- White circular handle with red border
- MAX FAN SPEED and SET FAN SPEED (0-3000 RPM range)

**Action Buttons** (5 in a row under graph):
- **Apply** (green `#10b981`) — apply current settings
- **Revert** (gray) — revert to last saved
- **Save Profile** (purple `#8b5cf6`) — opens save dialog for P1/P2 + load from file
- **Export** (cyan `#06b6d4`) — export all settings to JSON
- **Reset** (orange `#f59e0b`) — reset to default curve

**Temperature Icons** (4 display elements):
- BOARD, CPU, GPU: 80×80px icons with temperature overlay (white text, black outline)
- FAN: 80×80px icon with **continuous rotation animation** (20° increments, 100ms/frame)
- Fallback: colored circles if image files missing

**Save Profile Dialog** (400×250 popup):
- Save to P1 or P2 (purple buttons)
- Load from JSON file (cyan button, opens file dialog)
- Profiles store curve points, options, and timestamp
